yum: â€˜YAMLâ€™ Utilities & More

The goal of `yum` is to provide a number of functions to work with files
that contain one or more â€˜YAMLâ€™ fragments. Several packages (the
[`rock`](https://r-packages.gitlab.io/rock),
[`psyverse`](https://r-packages.gitlab.io/psyverse), and
[`justifier`](https://r-packages.gitlab.io/justifier) packages) leverage
the â€˜YAMLâ€™ format to facilitate systematic encoding of information in a
format that is both machine- and human-readable. The `yum` package
provides a number of functions to facilitate this in a uniform manner
with minimal dependencies (i.e.Â only `yaml`, suggesting `data.tree` to
enable additional functionality).

## Installation

You can install the released version of `yum` from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages('yum');
```

You can install the development version of `yum` from
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) with:

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab('r-packages/yum');
```

(assuming you have `remotes` installed; otherwise, install that first
using the `install.packages` function)

## Dependencies

`yum` was created to have minimal dependencies. It requires `yaml` to be
able to actually load (parse) the extracted YAML fragments, and you will
often want to have `data.tree` available to organise the results in a
tree if they have a hierarchical structure. Therefore, `yum` does have
some dependencies through those two suggested packages. Of these, `yaml`
only has one dependency, but `data.tree` has quite a few more.
<!-- Specifically, the dependency network looks like this: -->
